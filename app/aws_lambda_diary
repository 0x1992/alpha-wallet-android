Tutorial:

Role created for Lambda to assume while executing:

lambda-android-role

Roles created to run the lambda:

Cognito_JavaFunctionAndroidEventHandlerPoolAuth_Role
Cognito_JavaFunctionAndroidEventHandlerPoolUnauth_Role

I added the access to lambda for both rules, despite only one of them
(unauth) needs it according to the tutorial:

````
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
	"lambda:invokefunction"
    ],
    "Resource": [
	"arn:aws-cn:lambda:cn-north-1:247884073451:function:Express-Of-Trust"
    ]
}
````

I created an inline policy for
Cognito_JavaFunctionAndroidEventHandlerPoolAuth_Role although it may
not be needed after all.
