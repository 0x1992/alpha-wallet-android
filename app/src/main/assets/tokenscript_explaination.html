    TokenScript is a markup language which aims to provide a enhanced experience for token users and owners. The experience is enhanced with a cryptographic trust model and consistent user interface. A TokenScript associated with a token provides a user with a trusted and private way to use more advanced features; for example 'approve' on ERC20 or 'breedWithAuto' on Cryptokitties.
