    TokenScript is an open developer framework which enables smart tokens (like HTML in Web2.0). TokenScript aims to allow token owners/issuers to quickly and securely provide a rich interface to their users. AlphaWallet provides a reference implementation of TokenScript.
    TokenScript has already been used by tokenisation projects like FIFA and UEFA’s blockchain tickets, Bartercard’s Qoin ecommerce ecosystem, Karma Automobile’s car ownership portal and many more.
    A TokenScript associated with a token provides a user with a trusted and private way to use more advanced features; for example renewal of domain for ENS, 'approve' on ERC20 for partner contracts, and even for breeding Cryptokitties.
